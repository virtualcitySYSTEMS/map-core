### 6.1.0

#### Highlights

- Adds `VectorClusterGroup` concept to the `VcsApp`. For more details see [the documentation](documentation/vectorClusterGroup.md).
- Introduces `FlatGeobuf` support to the VC Map: A `FlatGeobufTileProvider` to load FlatGeobuf files in `VectorTile` layers and
  for smaller files a `FlatGeobufLayer` to load all features at once.
- Adds a rotation api that provides `startRotation` which returns a stop function. It rotates around a given or current viewpoint.
- Adds new `ClippingPolygonObject` and a `ClippingPolygonObjectCollection` to the `VcsApp`, which allows configured clipping regions. For more details see [the documentation](documentation/clipping.md).
- Add `Navigation` API to allow navigating through maps using keyboard or other controller.
- Adds a `renderScreenshot` function to the core that returns a canvas.
- Adds new string templating capabilities (moved here from @vcmap/ui). `renderTemplate` can handle string templates with `{{}}` placeholders and ol style expressions. see [the documentation](documentation/vcsTemplate.md).

#### Changes

- Adds a new `sourceVectorContextSync` to synchronize a vector source with a cesium `VectorContext`.
- `VectorContext` now implements the `hasFeature` interface, returning a boolean if the feature is currently managed by the context.
- Adds the `SourceObliqueSync` to sync a vector source with an oblique source.
- In mapCollection the `requestExclusiveMapControls` has been extended by an ID to identify the current map control holder. There is additionally an event `exclusiveMapControlsChanged` which is emitted when the exclusiveMapControls are changed.
- The `FeatureProviderInteraction` will now return a cluster feature, if more than one feature is provided at the position. Adds new symbol `isProvidedClusterFeature`, which is added to cluster features by FeatureProviders
- Adds a `resetExclusiveMapControls` in the mapCollection to reset the exclusiveMapControls.
- Adds new events `visualizationAdded` and `visualizationRemoved` to `VcsMap`, which allows tracking of layer implementations being added or removed.
- Update Dependencies
  - openlayers to 10.4.0
  - proj4 to 2.15.0
  - uuid 11.1.0
- Fixes a bug, where `allowPicking` would have no effect on `CesiumTilesetLayer`.
- Adds an API to the `FeatureAtPixelInteraction` to allow for features to be excluded from pickPosition.
- Adds the `outlineColor` option to `CesiumTilesetLayer` to allow for customizing the outline color of the tileset.

### 6.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

- Updated Openlayers to 10.2.1
- Updated Cesium to 1.121
- Removed the `defaultPointcloudStyle` from the API, just use `defaultDeclarativeStyle`
- Changed the FeatureLayer defaultStyle to a be an emtpy `DeclarativeStyleItem`
- `OverrideCollection` is now generic to the serialization type.
- `Category` is now generic to the serialization type.
- InteractionEvents position & pixelOrPosition may return 2D coordinates (if emitted from a 2D map). This may be breaking, if you rely on a Z coordinate.
- Feature converter refactoring. Most of these are _breaking_ if you rely on any feature converter APIs directly, make sure to follow up on the docs:
  - New VectorHeightInfo types. VectorHeightInfo now only exposes properties required
    for the specified height reference. Changed the way `create*Primitive` helpers work and renamed to `create*PrimitiveItem`. These are
    now more specific and return `ConvertedItem` instead of just the primitive.
  - Removed multiple no longer needed feature converter helpers: `getHeightAboveGround`, `getMinHeightOrGroundLevel` & `addPrimitivesToContext`
  - CesiumVectorContext changes.
    - The context is no longer passed to the feature converter.
    - The CesiumVectorContext has a new, clearer interface and now exposes async `addFeature` & `removeFeature`.
    - There is no more feature cache, since the new async API made this obsolete.
    - VectorContextHelpers `removeArrayFromCollection`, `removeFeatureFromMap` & `addPrimitiveToContext` have been removed.
  - VectorProperties changes:
    - VectorProperties has been extended to handle new cesium altitude modes. The new
      modes are: `relativeToTerrain`, `relativeTo3DTiles`, `clampToTerrain` & `clampTo3DTiles`.
    - `heightAboveGround` may now be `undefined` to handle new `relativeTo*` altitude modes.
    - Introduced a `renderAs(feature: Feature): 'geometry' | 'model' | 'primitive'` API for
      point features.
  - Changed the VectorGeometryFactory types drastically. You now also have access to
    the geometry factory APIs: `getArcGeometryFactory`, `getCircleGeometryFactory`, `getArcGeometryFactory`
    `getLineStringGeometryFactory` & `getPolygonGeometryFactory` respectively. All `*ToCesium` functions
    have been completely removed. If you relied on this API, just use convert directly.
  - Since points do not expose a geometry factory, a new `getPointPrimitives` API has been
    introduced, replacing what `pointToCesium` used to do.
  - Changed the way `convert` works. The new async API does not rely on sideeffects on VectorContext,
    but instead resolves to an array of `ConvertedItem`s.
  - Introduced `setupClampedPrimitive`, an API to clamp a primitive to the scene based on a
    height reference (used internally to create `relativeTo*` primitives).
  - Changed the way coordinates are transformed to be used with a specific height info.
    `getCartesian3AndWGS84FromCoordinates` has been removed, two new helpers have been introduced instead:
    `mercatorToWgs84TransformerForHeightInfo` & `mercatorToCartesianTransformerForHeightInfo` and
    specifically for points: `getWgs84CoordinatesForPoint`.
  - Fixed a bug, where relative geometries where rendered absolute.
- Changes to the editor:
  - removed helpers: `ensureFeatureAbsolute` & `clampFeature`.
  - vertices may have 2D coordinate layouts.
  - added a helper to handle mixed 2D & 3D vertices: `getCoordinatesAndLayoutFromVertices`.
  - it is now possible to rotate & scale points rendered as models or primitives using handlers.
  - snapping to orthogonal or parallels of the current geometry being edited is now possible.
  - snapping is now also possible to features within vector layers. by default, the editing layer is snapped to.
  - renamed previously unused symbol `vertexIndex` to `vertexIndexSymbol`. the symbol is now correctly set on vertices.
  - Editors will always pick the position of the scene, instead of shooting through objects.
  - Adds an `isVertex` helper for editor interactions.
  - New `SegmentLengthInteraction` added to the editor. Displays segment length of polygons, line strings, circles & bboxes.
- To better illustrate its use, `getFlatCoordinatesForGeometry` was renamed to `getFlatCoordinateReferences`.
- `VectorPropeties.getModelOptions` no longer returns an empty object, but undefined, if model options is not defined anywhere.
- Vector layer will maintain drawing order in 3D.
- Removed `excludedPickPositionEvents` from `FeatureAtPixelInteraction`.
- deprecates `placeGeometryOnTerrain` and `drapeGeometryOnTerrain`
- Renames `placeGeometryOnGround` to `drapeGeometryOnSurface`

#### Changes

- Added `contextOptions` to `CesiumMap` to allow configure the CesiumWidget WebGL Context, see:
- Added getter to `CesiumMap` for the `defaultShadowMap`
- Added `minRenderingLevel` and `maxRenderingLevel` to all `Rasterlayer` and `OpenstreetMapLayer`, this can be used to constrain the levels at which the data should be rendered
- Added `imageryLayerOptions` to `RasterLayer` and `OpenstreetMapLayer` to forward Cesium ImageryLayer Option to the cesium Instance
- Add new `changed` event to FlightPlayerClock
- Adds isDestroyed() to `VcsCameraPrimitive`

- Adds new helpers to change geometry layouts from XY to XYZ.
- Adds a `createAbsoluteFeature` helper to resolve features of the current session to an absolute state.
- Added new option `msaa` to DisplayQuality
- Adds two new helpers: `spherical2Distance` & `ecef3DDistance` to calculate actual distance on sphere or in 3D space.Â¨
- Introduces a new `getAttributes` API on Cesium3DTileFeature, Cesium3DTilePointFeature, Entity & ol.Feature to get attributes.
  This works for 1.0 and 1.1 Cesium3DTile data sets. On ol.Feature it is an alias for getProperties _without_ the geometry.
- New `primitive` rendering of vector tile features.
- Add the `StaticFeatureTileProvider` tile provider, which serves runtime openlayers features as a tile provider.
- Adds `placeGeometryOnSurface`

  changing a collection, if the current viewpoint cannot be shown, the new collection
  will not be set and the `failedToSetCollection` event will be called with the
  failing collection.
